NEWS for rsync 3.1.3 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 31 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.1.2:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Don't output about a new backup dir with appropriate info verbosity.
    - Fixed some issues with the sort functions in support/rsyncstats.
    - Added a way to specify group names that contain spaces in daemon config.
    - If a backup fails (e.g. full disk) rsync exits with an error.
    - Avoid invalid output in the summary if either the start or end time had
      an error.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added the ability for rsync to compare nanosecond times in its file-check
      comparisons.  Also added a short-option (-@) for --modify-window.
    - Added the --checksum-choice=NAME[,NAME] option to choose the checksum
      algorithms.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Tweak the "make" output when yodl isn't around to create the man pages.
    - Changed an obsolete compile macro in configure.
